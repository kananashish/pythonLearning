# Python Data Science Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my **Python for Data Science** learning repository! This is where I document my path from learning Python basics to mastering data science tools and techniques.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside?
This repository is divided into different sections to track my progress, from fundamental Python skills to data analysis and machine learning projects.

### 1. **Python Basics**
   - Variables, data types, and operators
   - Control flow (loops, conditionals)
   - Functions, modules, and file handling

### 2. **Data Science Essentials**
   - **NumPy**: Working with arrays and numerical operations
   - **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
   - **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Data visualization

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Loading datasets and cleaning data
   - Discovering insights through visualization

### 4. **Machine Learning Foundations**
   - Basic machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees)
   - Introduction to scikit-learn

### 5. **Projects**
   - Practical applications and mini-projects to apply Python in real-world data problems

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose
This repository is part of my commitment to learning Python and diving deep into the world of data science. It serves as a portfolio of my progress and as a resource for anyone else interested in Python for data science.
